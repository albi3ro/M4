    "When cleaning my apartment, sometimes I just grab the nearest dirty thing to me and try to do something to it.  But that is not the most efficient way to get things done.  If I'm planning, I'll first dedicate my attention to one problem, like putting clothing away, then rotate my attention to something else, like dirty dishes.  I can keep focused on just one task and do it well.  Each problem I solve optimally in shorter intervals instead of tackling everything at once.  \n",
